      I'm a writer, software engineer, digital creator and content manager, and influencer. I am passionate about sex education, social justice, data privacy, and internet and media literacy. My tech toolbox includes: CSS, HTML, Bootstrap, vanilla JavaScript, PostgreSQL, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, and React.

      You can find my words in Playboy, the Huffington Post, Elle, Harper's Bazaar, and other digital publications. I'm currently working on my first book, <b>How To Live With The Internet And Not Let It Run Your Life</b>. It's slated for release in March 2021 with Smith Street Books. You can preorder it from Target <a href="https://www.target.com/p/how-to-live-with-the-internet-and-not-let-it-run-your-life-by-gabrielle-alexa-noel-hardcover/-/A-81089989">here</a> or from Amazon <a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Live-Internet-Your-Life/dp/1922417033/">here</a>.

 With over 25 thousand followers on Instagram, I use social media for education, storytelling, and brand/product awareness. I've been featured in Bustle, Well and Good, and Cherry Magazine, and provided insight for Rolling Stone, Refinery29, Women's Health Magazine, and more. I am also a peer educator, leading workshops on cannabis justice, identity, and sexual wellness.
