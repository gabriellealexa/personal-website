          <h2>about the developer:</h2>
        
            I'm a full stack developer with an appreciation for the social elements of tech. I love how it can be used to enhance relationships, health/wellness, and advocacy.<br /><br />
            
            From a very young age, I fell in love with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. I did, after all, grow up during the Neopets/Myspace era of the Internet. As a student at Laguardia Community College, I learned even more about frontend web development and the full Adobe Creative Suite. And finally, I honed those skills at Flatiron School, an immersive bootcamp that focused on Ruby, Sinatra, Ruby on Rails, vanilla JavaScript, and React.
